# Portfolio of Agner Piton

Here you can find some of my data science projects.

### [Project 1: Sleep stage classification](https://github.com/AgnerPiton/Portfolio/blob/master/Sleep_Stage_Classification.py)

- Goal of identifying which of the 5 sleep stages the participant was by using his/her brain wave signals. 
- Use of 2 towers 2D convolutions.

### [Project 2: Speech recognition](https://github.com/AgnerPiton/Portfolio/blob/master/Speech_Recognition_Regression.py)

- Goal of correctly identifying sounds of words. 
- Use of neural networks keras sequential model.

### [Project 3: Spatiotemporal Analysis](https://github.com/AgnerPiton/Portfolio/blob/master/Spatiotemporal_analysis.ipynb)
- Explorations of a dataset of virus incidence. Autocorrelation, Krigging, incidence maps and time series data.


### [Project 4: IMDB dataset explorations](https://github.com/AgnerPiton/Portfolio/blob/master/IMDB_explorations.ipynb)
- Exploration of the IMDB dataset, organizing and cleaning data and a simples 
- Pandas, NumPy, SkLearn.
Prediction of IMDB score using:
- Logistic Regression. - RMSE=1.029
- Random Forest regressor. - RMSE=0.862
