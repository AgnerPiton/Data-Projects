# Samples of my data science projects.

### [Project 1: Sleep stage classification](https://github.com/AgnerPiton/Portfolio/blob/master/Sleep_Stage_Classification.py)

- Goal of identifying which of the 5 sleep stages the participant was by using his/her brain wave signals. 
- Use of 2 towers 2D convolutions.

### [Project 2: Speech recognition](https://github.com/AgnerPiton/Portfolio/blob/master/Speech_recognition.ipynb)

Overview: Task is to learn to recognize which of several English words is pronounced in an audio recording. 

- Wave files transformed to arrays using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients - This can be done using libraries as: from python_speech_features import mfcc
- Numpy, pandas, Keras. 
- Encoder for the words.
- Use of neural networks keras sequential model. 
- 90% accuracy of identyfing words on validation set.

### [Project 3: Spatiotemporal Analysis](https://github.com/AgnerPiton/Portfolio/blob/master/Spatiotemporal_analysis.ipynb)
- Explorations of a dataset of virus incidence
- Pandas, Scypy, Pysal, geopandas.
- Autocorrelation, Krigging, variogram, incidence maps and time series data.

Incidence of Virus per location:

### [Project 4: IMDB dataset explorations](https://github.com/AgnerPiton/Portfolio/blob/master/IMDB_explorations.ipynb)
- Exploration of the IMDB dataset, organizing and cleaning data.
- Pandas, NumPy, SkLearn.

Prediction of IMDB score using:
- Logistic Regression. - RMSE=1.029
- Random Forest regressor. - RMSE=0.862

### [Project 5: Housing dataset explorations](https://github.com/AgnerPiton/Portfolio/blob/master/Housing_explorations.ipynb)
- Preparing, visualizing and cleaning data.
- Pandas, Matplot, SkLearn.
- Performing Linear regression to predict median prices of houses.

Features with higher influence on housing prices.
